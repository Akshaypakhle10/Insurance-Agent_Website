           <h1>HEALTH PLAN</h1>

           <p class="intro"><b>Health Insurance,</b> also known as Mediclaim in India, is a form of insurance which covers the expenses incurred on medical treatment and hospitalisation. It covers the policyholder against any financial constraints arising from medical emergencies. In case of sudden hospitalisation, illness or accident, health insurance takes care of the expenses on medicines, oxygen, ambulance, blood, hospital room, various medical tests and almost all other costs involved. By paying a small premium every year, you can ensure that any big medical expenses, if incurred, will not burn a hole in your pocket. The plan can be taken for an individual or for your family as a Family Floater Health Insurance Plan.</p>
