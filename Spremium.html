                * <b>Paid-up Value – </b>If the policyholder has paid the first three years’ premiums and future premiums have been not paid, the policy becomes a paid-up policy. Any rider attached to the plan lapses if the policy becomes paid-up. Guaranteed Additions and bonuses do not accrue further under the plan. The benefits under the plan are reduced and are calculated as follows:<br>
                <b>Paid-up Sum Assured =</b> Basic Sum Assured * (number of premiums paid / total number of premiums payable) + vested Guaranteed Additions and bonuses. On maturity, the Paid-up Sum Assured would be payable as annuity as per vesting benefit. On death, the nominee can take the benefit partly or wholly in lump sum or annuity. <br>
                * <b>Surrender Value -</b> If the policyholder wants, he can surrender his policy and avail the Surrender Value.

                <br>
                <b>GSV for Regular Premium plans =</b> (total premiums paid including bonus and Guaranteed Additions* GSV Factor) <br>
                <b>GSV for Single Premium Plans =</b> 90% of the Single Premium paid + vested Guaranteed Additions and bonus<br>
                <b>SSV</b> is declared by the company based on its performance and is calculated as follows:<br>
                <b>SSV</b> Factor * total premiums paid including bonus and Guaranteed Additions.<br>
                * <b>The Surrender Value</b> can be used to buy an immediate annuity after commuting 1/3rd of the corpus from the company. Alternatively, a Single Premium deferred Annuity can also be purchased with the surrender value. <br>
                * <b>Free-look Period – </b>If the policyholder is not happy with the plan, he can cancel the policy within 15 days of the plan issuance. This period is called the free-look period. Upon cancellation, the premium paid net of any applicable expenses would be returned.
