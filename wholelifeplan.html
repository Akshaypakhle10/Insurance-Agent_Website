           <h1>WHOLE LIFE PLAN</h1>

           <p class="intro"><b>Whole Life plan</b> is also called as straight life, ordinary life. It remains throughout the insured whole lifetime provided the premiums are paid. A certain aforementioned amount is paid to the nominee in the event the insured dies. The policyholder at any time withdraw the policy or borrow against it. The maturity age for this policy is 100 years. If the insured lives past the maturity age, the policy will become matured endowment. The death benefit under this plan is tax free.</p>

            <h2>* <u>WHOLE LIFE PLAN BENEFITS:</u></h2> 

            
          <h3>1. Cover For Life:</h3> 
          <p> The insured will get cover for his entire life unlike other life insurance plans that is fixed for a certain period. The other life insurance plans will expire and it will be expensive to take another one when you really want one. In the event you die, a lump sum tax free amount is paid to the nominee. If you outlive the term, you will not receive any return. For example if a 25 year old takes a whole life plan at the age of 25 years, he will receive a lump sum payment at the age of 45, the age at which his 20 year premium payment term will expire. He can use this money for his retirement and also his cover will continue till he turns 100 or till the date he dies.</p>

          <h3>2.Assurance Of Coverage, Periodic Payments And Tax Benefits :</h3> 
           <p>The survival benefits will be built over time which keeps increasing over time. You will get lifetime coverage along with guaranteed level premiums for a limited premium payment term. The premium is constant throughout the premium payment term. Sum assured is guaranteed and the bonuses are declared based on the performance. Some companies offer survival benefit from the end of the premium payment term till the policy matures. Tax benefits are also available to the insured under Section 80C and Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>


           <h3>3.Serves As A Source Of Cash :</h3>
           <p>Financial experts believe that a person must keep 6-8 month’s living expenses in the form of liquid asset. It is however difficult to reserve such a huge cash while meeting retirement and long term saving goals. But with a whole life plan, you can get the cash at the end of the premium payment term.</p>

          <h3>4.Loan Option Available On Your Whole Life Plan Policy :</h3> 
          <p> The surrender value of the policy increases over time and you can borrow against the policy’s surrender value at any time. This is a better alternative against borrowing against home or retirement accounts.</p>

          <h3>5.Your Dependents Will Benefit From This Plan :</h3> 
          <p>The return will prove to be an additional financial source in the family. This plan is ideal for estate planning individuals who want to pass on their estate to their legal heir as it helps create wealth.</p>

               <h4> What happens when you stop paying the LIC New Jeevan Nidhi Premiums? </h4><br>
             <p class="intro">
                * <b>Paid-up Value – </b>If the policyholder has paid the first three years’ premiums and future premiums have been not paid, the policy becomes a paid-up policy. Any rider attached to the plan lapses if the policy becomes paid-up. Guaranteed Additions and bonuses do not accrue further under the plan. The benefits under the plan are reduced and are calculated as follows:<br>
                <b>Paid-up Sum Assured =</b> Basic Sum Assured * (number of premiums paid / total number of premiums payable) + vested Guaranteed Additions and bonuses. On maturity, the Paid-up Sum Assured would be payable as annuity as per vesting benefit. On death, the nominee can take the benefit partly or wholly in lump sum or annuity. <br>
                * <b>Surrender Value -</b> If the policyholder wants, he can surrender his policy and avail the Surrender Value. The policy acquires a Surrender Value only if the first three years’ premiums have been paid. Higher of the Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV) or the Special Surrender Value (SSV) is paid on surrendering the plan. GSV and SSV are calculated as follows:
                <br>
                <b>GSV for Regular Premium plans =</b> (total premiums paid including bonus and Guaranteed Additions* GSV Factor) <br>
                <b>GSV for Single Premium Plans =</b> 90% of the Single Premium paid + vested Guaranteed Additions and bonus<br>
                <b>SSV</b> is declared by the company based on its performance and is calculated as follows:<br>
                <b>SSV</b> Factor * total premiums paid including bonus and Guaranteed Additions.<br>
                * <b>The Surrender Value</b> can be used to buy an immediate annuity after commuting 1/3rd of the corpus from the company. Alternatively, a Single Premium deferred Annuity can also be purchased with the surrender value. <br>
                * <b>Free-look Period – </b>If the policyholder is not happy with the plan, he can cancel the policy within 15 days of the plan issuance. This period is called the free-look period. Upon cancellation, the premium paid net of any applicable expenses would be returned.
