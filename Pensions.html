           <h1>PENSION PLAN</h1>

           <p class="intro"><b>Pension plans or retirement plans</b> offer you the dual benefits of investment and insurance cover. It is nothing but investing a certain amount regularly to accumulate over a specific tenure in a phase-by-phase manner. This will ensure a steady flow of monthly pension once you retire. Provident Fund, for example, is a popular retirement planning scheme.</p>

            <h2>* <u>PENSION PLAN BENEFITS:</u></h2> 

            
          <h3>1. Provision of Regular Income Post Retirement:</h3> 
          <p> One of the biggest benefits of an pension plan is that it provides incomes after retirement. Pension schemes available in India help you cover your living expenses post retirement by providing a guaranteed income. With the variety of pension plans available out there, you can choose from one which suits your needs best. While some plans provide you with lifelong income, there are others which offer better returns.</p>

          <h3>2.Tax Benefits :</h3> 
           <p>Pension plans are entitled to tax exemption specified under Section 80C. If you want to contribute to pension plans, the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, offers significant tax respite under Chapter VI-A. Section 80C, 80CCC and 80CCD specify them in detail. For instance, Atal Pension Yojana (APY) and National Pension Scheme (NPS) are subject to tax deduction under 80CCD.</p>


           <h3>3.Death Benefit :</h3>
           <p>In the unfortunate event of the life assured passing away after risk commencement while the policy is in force, the sum assured on death and any accrued bonuses will be paid.</p>

          <h3>4.Corporation Profits :</h3> 
          <p> Policyholders are eligible to participate in profits earned by LIC, earning bonuses through the same.</p>

          <h3>5.Surrender Value :</h3> 
          <p>Individuals can surrender the policy (after completion of 3 years) to get an assured surrender value.</p>

          <h3>6.Rebates :</h3>
          <p> LIC provides a rebate on high premium amounts, helping one save money.</p>

         <h3>7.Loan :</h3>
         <p> One can avail a loan under this policy, helping them cater to emergencies.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="row no-bottom-margin1">

            <h2>* <u>Documents Required For Policy:</u></h2>
             <p> 1. Self Attested Photograph.<br>
                 2. Age Proof: (school certificate, passport, PAN card, driving license).<br>

                <h1>LIC JEEVAN AKSHAY VI PLAN.</h1>

                <div class="intro-box1">

                 <br><h4>What is mean by Jeevan Akshay VI Plan</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="intro">One of the plans is <b>LIC Jeevan Akshay </b>Plan. This policy plan is nothing but a pure pension plan for senior citizens. This product comes under Annuity type. Under annuity, people get a pension for a regular interval of time. The payment mode is to be decided by you. It’s a smart retirement investment plan.
                </p><BR>
                <BR>
                 
                 <h4> How does LIC Jeevan Akshay VI Policy work? </h4><br>
                 <p class="intro">
                     The policy premium term is single premium. At the beginning of the plan, you have to pay the premium of your choice. After deciding this you will be eligible for a regular pension. There is no life risk covered under this plan, as it’s a pure annuity plan and whatever you invest, you will get it as a pension. The ordinance for this has been passed by PM Narendra Modi and the cabinet in the month of January 2017. Due to this senior citizens will be benefitted. It is an immediate pension plan. So, if you pay the one shot premium of your choice, the annual payment will start from that moment. You don’t have to submit any medical certificate for this plan as it does not cover medic-claims or life risk.<br> <br>

                     <b>This plan gives us 7 different Annuity Options as below:</b><br>
                        Each option will be explained with a standard example.
                        <br>
                        Single premium: 5, 00, 000 INR<br>
                        Pension mode: Annual<br>
                        Annuitants Age: 60 years.<br><br>
                        <b>1. Annuity for Life:</b><br>
                        Under this plan, Annuitant will receive pension till lifetime. After that, this plan will not be eligible. According to above example, the annuitant is liable to get 48, 750 INR annually as a pension.<br><br>
                        <b>2. Annuity Guaranteed for Certain Period:</b><br>
                        Under this option, we have 4 sub choices. We can select the plan for 5,10,15 or 20 years. After selecting the plan the annuitant will get paid the annuity irrespective of if he is alive or not. The 4 options are as follows:<br>
                        <b>a. For 5 years:</b> The annuitant or the nominee will get 48, 300 INR as pension for 5 years. If the annuitant survives, he will get the same amount for rest of his life.<br>
                        <b>b. For 10 years:</b> The annuitant or the nominee will get 47, 300 INR as pension for 10 years. If the annuitant survives, he will get the same amount for rest of his life.<br>
                        <b>c. For 15 years:</b> The annuitant or the nominee will get 45, 950 INR as pension for 15 years. If the annuitant survives, he will get the same amount for rest of his life.<br>
                        <b>d. For 20 years:</b> The annuitant or the nominee will get 44, 400 INR as pension for 5 years. If the annuitant survives, he will get the same amount for rest of his life.<br><br>
                        <b>3. Annuity with return of purchase price on death:</b><br>
                     Under this option, the annuitant gets the benefit till he/she is alive. On the death of the annuitant, the nominee gets the full refund of Single premium paid. So according to the above example, the annuitant will get 37, 550 INR as annual pension till he/she is alive. After the death of the annuitant, the nominee receives 5, 00, 000 INR.<br>
                     This option is similar to fixed deposit as it is giving you the invested money back along with the pension benefit.<br><br>
                     <b>4. Increasing Annuity:</b><br>
                     Under this option, the annuitant gets the benefit till he/ she is alive. The pension amount will increase every year by 3%. So according to the above example, the annuitant will get 39, 650 INR as annual pension till he/she is alive. Every year the pension will be increased by 1, 190 INR, which is 3% of 39, 650 INR.<br><br>
                     <b>5. Joint Life Last Survivor Annuity with 50% for spouse:</b><br>
                     Under this option, the annuitant gets the benefit till he/ she is alive. On the death of the annuitant, the nominee gets the pension which is 50% of the annuity. So according to the above example, the annuitant will get 45, 200 INR as annual pension till he/she is alive. After the death of the annuitant, the nominee receives 22, 600INR every year.<br><br>
                     <b>6. Joint Life Last Survivor Annuity with 100% for spouse:</b><br>
                     Under this option, the annuitant gets the benefit till he/ she is alive. On the death of the annuitant, the nominee gets the pension which is 100% of the annuity. So according to the above example, the annuitant will get 42, 150 INR as annual pension till he/she is alive. After the death of the annuitant, the nominee receives 42, 150 INR every year.<br><br>
                     <b>7. Joint Life Last Survivor with Return of Purchase Price:</b><br>
                     Under this option, the annuitant gets the benefit till he/she is alive. On the death of the annuitant, the nominee gets the full pension every year. The actual amount is returned on the death of Annuitant and spouse. So according to the above example, the annuitant will get 37, 050 INR as annual pension till he/she is alive. After the death of the annuitant, the nominee receives 37, 050 INR. On the death of a spouse the actual amount of 5, 00,000 INR is returned.

                * <b>Paid-up Value – </b>If the policyholder has paid the first three years’ premiums and future premiums have been not paid, the policy becomes a paid-up policy. Any rider attached to the plan lapses if the policy becomes paid-up. Guaranteed Additions and bonuses do not accrue further under the plan. The benefits under the plan are reduced and are calculated as follows:<br>
                <b>Paid-up Sum Assured =</b> Basic Sum Assured * (number of premiums paid / total number of premiums payable) + vested Guaranteed Additions and bonuses. On maturity, the Paid-up Sum Assured would be payable as annuity as per vesting benefit. On death, the nominee can take the benefit partly or wholly in lump sum or annuity. <br>

                <br>
                <b>GSV for Regular Premium plans =</b> (total premiums paid including bonus and Guaranteed Additions* GSV Factor) <br>
                <b>GSV for Single Premium Plans =</b> 90% of the Single Premium paid + vested Guaranteed Additions and bonus<br>
                <b>SSV</b> is declared by the company based on its performance and is calculated as follows:<br>
                <b>SSV</b> Factor * total premiums paid including bonus and Guaranteed Additions.<br>
                * <b>The Surrender Value</b> can be used to buy an immediate annuity after commuting 1/3rd of the corpus from the company. Alternatively, a Single Premium deferred Annuity can also be purchased with the surrender value. <br>
                * <b>Free-look Period – </b>If the policyholder is not happy with the plan, he can cancel the policy within 15 days of the plan issuance. This period is called the free-look period. Upon cancellation, the premium paid net of any applicable expenses would be returned.
